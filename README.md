# React CRUD Application

This is a simple React application that demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The application allows users to manage a list of items (e.g., users, tasks, products) and provides a straightforward interface for interacting with the data.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new items to the list.
- **Read**: View a list of items.
- **Update**: Edit existing items.
- **Delete**: Remove items from the list.
- **Responsive UI**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different pages.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to a backend API.
- **Bootstrap** or **Material-UI** (or any other CSS framework): For styling the application.
- **JSON Server** (optional): To simulate a backend REST API.
